``` r
#Load the dataset
weather_data=get("early_january_weather")
```

Discription: This data set including some improtant variables for Newark
Liberty International Airport such as date of the weathering days, the
temperature, some important information regarding the wind like wind
speed and pressure. Values like wind_speed and wind_gust(though some
parts are missing) can have some influence for the planes to take off.
This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns in total. The mean temperature
for January in Newark Liberty International Airport is 39.5821229.

``` r
timehour_temp_scatterplot<-ggplot(data=weather_data,aes(x=time_hour,y=temp,color=humid))+geom_point()
print(timehour_temp_scatterplot)
```

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

For this graph, we can see that the average temperature of EWR is
generally raising since the beginning of January, and for the color
bars, the humid level is usually high during daytime, since as the temp
drop it’s usually during nighttime.

\#Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(123)
df<-data_frame(normal_sample=rnorm(10),logical_vector=normal_sample>0, character_vector =c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"),factor_vector =factor(c("tiny","medium","huge","tiny","medium","huge","tiny","medium","huge","tiny")))
```

    ## Warning: `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0.
    ## ℹ Please use `tibble()` instead.
    ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was
    ## generated.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mean_normal_sample <- mean(pull(df, normal_sample))
mean_logical_vector <- mean(pull(df, logical_vector), na.rm = TRUE)
mean_character_vector <- mean(as.numeric(pull(df,character_vector)),na.rm = TRUE)
mean_factor_vector <- mean(as.numeric(pull(df,factor_vector)),na.rm = TRUE)
c(mean_normal_sample, mean_logical_vector, mean_character_vector, mean_factor_vector)
```

Without the as.mumeric function, the normal mean() functuon is unable to
give the results, since some of the information provided for the df
dataframe is not numerical thus couldnt return normal numeric results.
However, as we use as.numeric function, elements like vectors and
charaters could be easily converted to numbers and get the means out.
